  "title": "EIP-7975: eth/70 - partial block receipt lists",
  "status": "Draft",
  "description": "Modifies the eth p2p protocol to allow requesting partial block receipt lists. As block gas limits increase, receipt lists may exceed the 10MiB message size limit, causing sync failures. This EIP introduces pagination via a lastBlockIncomplete flag and firstBlockReceiptIndex field.",
