  "status": "Draft",
  "description": "Adds peer-to-peer exchange of block-level access lists to the eth protocol. Introduces GetBlockAccessLists and BlockAccessLists messages, enabling peers to request and serve BALs for synchronization and parallel execution. Requires EIP-7928 (Block-Level Access Lists).",
